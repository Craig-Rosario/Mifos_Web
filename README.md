Currently There is an issue with the use of tremor and React 19<br>
This leads to errors while setting up the project
<br>
Although a more permanent fix would be to Replace tremor charts completely by ShadCN charts library
<br>
For now, please run the following commands to view the project in the following directory (..\Mifos_Web\Mifos_Web):
<br>
<br>
npm install react@18 react-dom@18
<br>
npm install
<br>
npm run dev
<br>
(DO NOTE, that since we are moving to a previous react version, there are issues with ShadCN/ Alignment/ Dropdown not loading properly)
<br>
But the general layout of the website can be seen with no probelms
